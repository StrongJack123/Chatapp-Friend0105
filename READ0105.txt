** Dear Client **

How are you?

Now I am trying to get job,but things are not going well, so if you have some job, I think you can give me … monthly 2000 ~ 3000 job is ok for me.. You can commit here… 

If you hire me, I will give you 30% of the earning on that job. So, in this moment, I really need some help….

Looking forward to hearing from you.

If you have something to commit, you can check this and comment there.
